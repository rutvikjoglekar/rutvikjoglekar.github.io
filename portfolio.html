	<h1>Data science and analytics portfolio</h1>

	<p style="font-size: larger">I have substantial experience with statistical programming (i.e., R, Python, SAS, and Stata) from my time as an MBA student at MIT, economic consultant at Bates White, and undergraduate economics student at UChicago. </p>

	<div class="col-8"><span class="inner"><p style="font-size: larger">While at MIT, my coursework either expanded or heavily leveraged my data analytics skills. For example, in Alphanomics (15.465), I wrote scripts that tapped into the AlphaVantage API to download various financial metrics (e.g., income statement) for a randomized set of publicly-traded stocks. I then calculated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piotroski_F-score">Piotroski f-scores</a> and after backtesting, show that stocks with higher f-scores can outperform the market. Other data-heavy courses included <a href="http://student.mit.edu/catalog/m15a.html#15.060">Data, Models, and Decisions (15.060)</a>, <a href="student.mit.edu/catalog/m15a.html#15.071">the Analytics Edge (15.071)</a> , and <a href="http://student.mit.edu/catalog/m16b.html#16.71">the Airline Industry (16.71)</a> .</p></div>

I worked on projects ranging from estimating a pharmaceutical firm’s financial liability in the opioid crisis to valuing cancer claims in a product liability dispute. I was also responsible for translating technical analyses into language understandable to a jury for expert reports that would be submitted to court. Toward the end of my time at Bates White, I was managing case teams.</p></div>

In my favorite project, I analyzed data from Princeton’s Empirical Studies of Conflicts (ESOC) project to isolate factors that drove voter turnout in the December 2005 Iraqi elections. I found that aside from education, public infrastructure (e.g., stable public electricity, garbage collection) have significant effects on democratic participation.</p></div>
