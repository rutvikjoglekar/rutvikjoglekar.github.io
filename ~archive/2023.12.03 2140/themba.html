							<h1>The MBA</h1>

							<p style="font-size: larger">I’m a (very) recent graduate of MIT Sloan’s full-time MBA program, having completed the degree earlier this summer. A burning question for many MBA hopefuls, one which I also had when I was applying in the middle of the pandemic back in 2020, is whether the degree is “worth it.” As is the case with many questions in life, the answer is difficult to answer and is a resounding “maybe.”</p>
							<p style="font-size: larger">In a future post, I’ll cover anecdotal instances of cases in which the MBA may have been worth it as well as cases in which it may be less valuable – coming directly from what I saw at MIT Sloan. But before doing that, I’ll dive deep into my own situation to help answer this burning question.</p>
							<p style="font-size: larger">In 2020, I was working as an economic consultant in Washington, DC. Economic consulting is a very niche industry, but in essence, it involves working with economists to quantify damages in high-stakes litigation. For example, if Apple were to sue Samsung over patent infringement, the law firms on both sides of this case (which would be your traditional big law firms), would hire economic consulting firms like Analysis Group, Bates White, or Cornerstone Research to quantify economic losses. Effectively, you’re helping to come up with a number in court.</p>
							<p style="font-size: larger">My total compensation in DC was in the range of $110-130K at the time. However, because of the ‘skilled labor shortage’ that occurred during the pandemic, Bates White raised salaries across the board due to high attrition: the same level, by 2023, was paying economic consultants between $140-160K. If I factor in potential promotions, I suspect my salary would be in the neighborhood of $180-200K.</p>
							<p style="font-size: larger">But I was fed up with economic consulting: while my hours weren’t terrible – probably in the neighborhood of 50-hour work weeks – I found the day-to-day meticulous, relatively stressful, and at times, excruciatingly boring (talk to any economic consultant or first-year attorney who has had to spend days on document review). I was yearning for change and wanted to pivot to product management – I wanted to have more creative flexibility and impact on what I was working on.</p>
							<p style="font-size: larger">If I were to make the pivot to product management without an MBA, I suspect I would be forced into a more junior role than an MBA would allow. Because I had no prior experience in product, I estimate this to be around $100-120K, perhaps joining as a product analyst before becoming a product manager. I hesitate to extrapolate my salary trajectory if I were to make the pivot absent an MBA – it seems like a tenuous exercise.</p>
